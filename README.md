# My first project with React library

For my first project using React, I decided to reuse an old team project we did during our BeCode training.

Our exercise was : Use [theMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr) api and create a front with its data.
- name
- overview
- trailer
- image
- and more...

## Language use

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Javascript-yellow"> 
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-blue"> 
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Material--ui-informational"> 
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sass-pink"> 

## Installation

### After clone this repository

``` npm -install ```

To install all dependencies ( you can look at all dependencies inside of <  package.json > ) file.

### Start sass, and run project

``` npm start ```

To run the project (localhost:portExample3000).

``` npm run sass ```

To start watching with Sass.

### Get your own api key

Before going to the next step you must have an account on [the movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr) then get your api key.

When you have your api key, you have to create a hidden folder in the "src" folder, inside this one you have to create a javascript file and insert this : 

``` 
const api_key = <insert your api key here>;

export default api_key;
 ```

And that's done !
